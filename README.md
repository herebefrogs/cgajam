# Deja Vu 

My game entry for CGA Jam 2017 on the theme "History repeats", 
Deja Vu is a short game completable in the duration of Jupiter Hadley's attention span (1 minute).

# How to play

You are cursed. Locked in an ever repeating room. Unravel its mysteries to lift the curse and break free.

Press ENTER to start the game, use the arrow keys or WASD (ZQSD with a French keyboard layout) to move around.

## Spoilers ahead

The goal is to reach the East door. Keys open chests. Swords break wood crates.
The room resets every time you exit it via the South door, and so does your item inventory!
(e.g. if you collected a sword and used it, you get it back when you exit the room)
